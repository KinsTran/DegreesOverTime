################################### Reading in Data (40 points) ###################################
# In this section, we'll read in a .csv file, which is essentially a tabular row/column layout
# This is like Microsoft Excel or Google Docs, but without the formatting.
# The .csv file we'll be working with has the life expectancy for each country in 1960 and 2013.
# We'll ask real-world questions about the data by writing the code that answers our question. Here are the steps you should walk through:
# Using the `read.csv` funciton, read the life_expectancy.csv file into a variable called `life.expectancy`
# Makes sure not to read strings as factors
life.expectancy <- read.csv(file = "life_expectancy.csv")
# Determine if life.expectancy is a data.frame by using the is.data.frame function. You may also want to View() it.
# Create a column `life.expectancy$change` that is the change in life expectancy from 1960 to 2013
# Create a variable `most.improved` that is the name of the country with the largest gain in life expectancy
# Create a variable `num.small.gain` that has the number of countries whose life expectance has improved fewer than 5 years between 1960 and 2013
# Write a function `CountryChange` that takes in a country's name as a parameter, and returns it's change in life expectancy from 1960 to 2013
# Using your `CountryChange` funciton, create a variable `sweden.change` that is the change in life expectancy from 1960 to 2013 in Sweden
# Define a function `LowestLifeExpInRegion` that takes in a **region** as an argument, and returns
# the **name of the country** with the lowest life expectancy in 2013 (in that region)
# Using the function you just wrote, create a variable `lowest.in.south.asia` that is the country with the lowest life expectancy in 2013 in South Asia
# Write a function `BiggerChange` that takes in two country names as parameters, and returns a sentence that
# describes which country experienced a larger gain in life expectancy (and by how many years).
# For example, if you passed the values "China", and "Bolivia" into your function, it would return this:
# "The country with the bigger change in life expectancy was China (gain=31.9), whose life expectancy grew by 7.4 years more than Bolivia's (gain=24.5)."
# Make sure to round your numbers.
# Using your `BiggerChange` funciton, create a variable `usa.or.france` that describes who had a larger gain in life expectancy (the United States or France)
# Write your `life.expectancy` data.frame to a new .csv file to your data/ directory with the filename `life_expectancy_with_change.csv`. Make sure not to write row names.
